# Important findings

#Based on the findings, there are 2,672,662 (81.16%) regular users, 620,017 (18.83%), and 3,292,679  total users. 
#Based on the findings, spring (4,409) and summer (4,496) receive higher ride shares than fall (4,232) and winter (4,242).
#2012 had more riders (8,734) than 2011 (8645).
#Most days the weather was "clear, few clouds, partly cloudly, and cloudy (11,413) following by "mist/cloudy) (4544).
#On average, the ride share per day was primarily consistent hovering around 14.1%.
#Majority of the days, bikeshares were used wre not on a holiday. (16,879) while only 500 bikeshares were on a holiday. 
#A total of 11,865 were used if the day is neither a weekend or a holiday. 5514 were not. 

#Recode categorical variables 

#Are there variables that R has read in as numeric but should be categorical? (i.e., 
#Variables that should be character or factor variables.) Could this affect your analysis? Re-code such variables as necessary. â€¢

str(bikeshare) #check the datatypes of the original dataframe
str(bikesharenew) #check the datatypes of the new dataframe

# When using the structure command for the bikeshare dataset, we see that there
# several variables that will need to be converted from integer to a factor due 
# to its categorical nature, for example: 1. season will be need to be converted 
# because it is a fixed number of seasons in the year. 

#Based on the initial re-factoring of the data, the counts per categorical variable is the same, as the
#original variables in the original dataframe. The analysis is not impacted for the total counts. When finding the 
#univariate descriptive statistics such as standard deviation, mean, and median the output is changed to reflect the exact 
#integer values, instead of reflecting a exponential value. 


#Convert the fields from integer to categorical and create a new dataframe to store results.
